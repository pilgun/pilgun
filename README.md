## Hi there 👋

I am a Computer Scientist specializing in the analysis of Android applications. 

Currently, I am focused on [ACVTool](https://github.com/pilgun/acvtool), a new approach to examining the behavior of third-party Android apps. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize the area of Program Analysis.

Research Areas:
- Reverse Engineering
- Malware Analysis
- Automated Testing

Here is a few other remarkable hats I've worn:

- 🧢 Reverse Engineer in a few FinTech startups </br>
- 🕵🏻 Android Malware Analyst</br>
- 👒 Bold and desperate unemployed entrepreneur</br>
- 🧙‍♂️ PhD Researcher and PostDoc at the University of Luxembourg</br>
- 👨‍💻 Software Engineer focused on Web solutions</br>
